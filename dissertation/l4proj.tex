\section{Guidance}

\textbf{Motivate} 
Activity trackers are very popular nowadays. These apps leverage various motivators, such as social feeds, points for activity, and reminders. However, most of these apps do not leverage collaborative motivators. I wanted to investigate whether or not users would feel more motivated to exercise if it wasn't just about working towards a personal goal, but towards a shared goal with a team of friends/strangers. The goal of my RPG themed activity tracker, 'Stat Buff' was to gamify progress as ingame character development (leading to greater attack damage), and workouts as attacks towards your teams enemy. This rewards users for making progress in their performance, as well as for making small daily efforts. The teams enemy resets in a week if it has not been defeated, which creates an urgency to exercise in order to to reach the next enemy.
\section{Writing guidance}
\subsection{Who is the reader?}

This is the key question for any writing. Your reader:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    is a trained computer scientist: \emph{don't explain basics}.
    \item
    has limited time: \emph{keep on topic}.
    \item
    has no idea why anyone would want to do this: \emph{motivate clearly}
    \item
    might not know \emph{anything} about your project in particular:
    \emph{explain your project}.
    \item
    but might know precise details and check them: \emph{be precise and
    strive for accuracy.}
    \item
    doesn't know or care about you: \emph{personal discussions are
    irrelevant}.
\end{itemize}

Remember, you will be marked by your supervisor and one or more members
of staff. You might also have your project read by a prize-awarding
committee or possibly a future employer. Bear that in mind.

\chapter{Background}
The most similar research I could find on collaborative activity trackers was a paper on an app named 'Pass the Ball' cite{}. This app was very simple: a team has one ball, and the person with that ball could score points for the team by exercising, and pass it to others. This very simple idea lead to many feeling responsibility to exercise when they had the ball. It also lead to lots of issues: users hogging the ball, stealing the ball for a point penalty, etc. There were also issues for users with irregular schedules. This study made me understand the importance of accountability and structure, but also the possible friction that this can cause if not implemented well. I also looked into a case study on 'Spy Feet' cite{} which was a pedometer that let the user progress in a story through walking. The researchers were I did some research into the effectiveness of activity trackers. Although this was singleplayer and story based, it was reassuring to see that gamified abstractions motivated users to exercise more. I also did some research into the state of activity trackers as a whole. 'Behavior Change Techniques in Top-Ranked Mobile Apps for Physical Activity' cite{} talked about the lack of behavioural change techniques employed in top apps, aswell as the two primary categories: educational and motivational. This made me consider which route I should take (I leaned more towards motivational, with educational aspects). 'Apps of Steel: Are Exercise Apps Providing Consumers With Realistic Expectations?' cite{} came to the same conclusion as the earlier paper: apps don't use enough behavioural change techniques. I kept this in mind, but still kept my focus on collaborative aspects. I also read 'Personalizing Mobile Fitness Apps Using Reinforcement Learning', as I was interested in if it was possible to increase the effectiveness of the collaborative techniques through machine learning. This was out of scope to implement due to a lack of experience and time. I read 'A Tale of Two Perspectives: A Conceptual Framework of User Expectations and Experiences of Instructional Fitness Apps' in order to understand what users prioritize in activity trackers. The app found that content was most important for 47.2%, technical implementation and utilities 39.7%, and psychological features were the most important for 13.2% of users. Because of this, I decided that I should pay attention to content and technical details even if they aren't what is being studied, as this will make the app more attractive and usable for participants. Finally, I did some research into behaviour change by looking at 'Integrated Theory of Health Behavior Change'. cite{} I didn't have the time to implement most techniques, but it gave me a good understanding of how social support can be leveraged to drive behavioural change.

I analyzed existing exercise apps, and existing RPG games in order to better understand the two categories I am combining. I analyzed Stronglifts 5x5 and Jefit, two popular exercise apps. Both had inbuilt social features, and online forums to keep people motivated. They had some complicated exercise features like planning workouts that were out of scope for me. I found that Jefit had competitions, but no team based exercising. This clearly shows that there is space in the market for my app. I also analyzed existing RPG/fantasy mobile games. I found that the multiplayer games often had collaborative aspects: for instance, Clash of Clans has clans, were users need to give each other troops in order to optimally defend themselves. In many classic RPG games such as World of Warcraft, users often take specific roles, such as healer, tank, and damage dealer, who all have to work together to defeat harder and harder enemies. It was clear that collaboration was very important for existing multiplayer RPG/fantasy games. From this, I gathered that I should follow the RPG/fantasy model for collaboration, as it has been perfected over years.

\chapter{Analysis/Requirements}
Exercise is hard to do consistently, leading to high inactivity. Social and group based exercise (such as exercising with a friend or joining a class) are good solution for making people feel accountable, and forcing a schedule. Even then, exercise would still be for your own good, and not for some common goal. A collaborative activity tracker would try to remove the buy in of group based exercise (course cost, fixed schedule) and would make the user feel as though they were contributing to a collective success and not just an individual one.
\section{Guidance}
Make it clear how you derived the constrained form of your problem via a clear and logical process. 

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Design}
Users can join teams with friends or strangers. Each team is assigned an enemy with a particular level and hitpoints. Killing this enemy will take you to the next enemy, who has increased health. Failing to kill the enemy in the allocated time (1 week) resets it's health. Workouts allow you to attack your teams enemy a certain number of times (based on the difficulty of it) where each attack deals damage proportional to your real life relative strength. This aims to reward both effort and progress. There are 6 different animated heroes with idle/attack animations, and 8 different monsters with idle/take damage animations. I tried to make tracking workouts satisfying by showing an animation of your hero attacking the enemy after you track a workout. Streength is tracked through an API which includes 100s of exercises and workouts from a very simple autofilled form. I also added a text chat to each team, along with stats for each user, which should hopefully encourage discussion and collaboration.
\section{Guidance}
Design should cover the abstract design in such a way that someone else might be able to do what you did, but with a different language or library or tool.

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Implementation}
The server is built with a technology called Postgraphile. I usually find that a lot of my time goes into implementing basic server logic involving the database (fetch x, update y, delete z). A lot of time also goes into maintaining this code, as changes such as adding relations between data or adding attributes required editing existing queries. Postgraphile creates a GraphQL API from a Postgres database containing all basic CRUD operations, which updates whenever the database does. It did have a steep learning curve: by default, it has no security in regards to who can read and write rows and columns from the database. I'm used to implementing this logic on the server, and not the database. Eventually, I managed  to validate the clients token into a Google ID which was passed as a setting to the query. I then created rules based on the Google ID setting and the associated user by using row level security. These are boolean checks that are applied to rows, where true allows the operation, and false prevents it. An example might be that a group row can only be changed if the authenticated users group name matches the . Another problem I had was the need for side effects when database operations are made. As an example, tracking a workout should damage the current enemy, check if that enemy is dead, in which case the next leveled enemy is set. I solved this by creating database triggers, which are SQL functions that execute on certain operations, such as creating workouts. This created a nice separation between data changes and side effects: Postgraphile would catch client errors such as missing fields, and my database trigger would throw an error if it was implemented poorly. Finally, I implemented chat through Postgraphile's subscriptions. I did this through raising an event with the groups name, along with a row containing this event. Events were raised on chat send, workout create, or exercise personal best via triggers, where the corresponding chat, workout, and personal best was also sent. A client would then subscribe to their team's events. 

The client is built with Expo (a superset of React Native). When initially launching the app, there is a brief demo showing a user getting stronger as their character changes alongside this to communicate the connection with real world and in game strength. Upon swiping to the right, I show a user fight an enemy, and their teammate finishing that enemy off. I also mention that these attacks were triggered by working out. Swiping to the right once more shows checks related to the study (such as data collection, how to widthdraw, etc.). After this, there is a sign up button (Google for Android, Apple ID for iOS) and a username selection form. On subsequent app opens, you immediately go past the authentication. The app is pretty basic: There are two bottom tabs: "User" and "Group". User shows your character idling, and two buttons that let you track a workout or update exercises. I was concerned with the possible endangerement that my app could cause it's users, as it might encourage users to add weight too quickly while sacrificing form. To prevent this, I calculate the rate of progress from the old exercise log to the new one. If this rate passes an arbitrary threshold, I remind the user that progress shouldn't come through sacrificing form, and give them a link to YouTube search results showing form tutorials for that exercise. There is also my email address, in case someone wants to contact me (in accordance to the ethics guidelines). The group tab allows you to create a group, join a random public group, or search for a group to join. Groups can be password protected or public for anyone. Upon joining a group, the enemy health scales up (to keep difficulty consistent with more members). You will also now see this current group whenever you open the group tab. There are also statistics for different enemies and members, along with a chat showing events from members.

\section{General points}
These points apply to the whole dissertation, not just this chapter.


\subsection{Figures}
\emph{Always} refer to figures included, like Figure \ref{fig:relu}, in the body of the text. Include full, explanatory captions and make sure the figures look good on the page.
You may include multiple figures in one float, as in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic}, using \texttt{subcaption}, which is enabled in the template.



% Figures are important. Use them well.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/relu.pdf}    

    \caption{In figure captions, explain what the reader is looking at: ``A schematic of the rectifying linear unit, where $a$ is the output amplitude,
    $d$ is a configurable dead-zone, and $Z_j$ is the input signal'', as well as why the reader is looking at this: 
    ``It is notable that there is no activation \emph{at all} below 0, which explains our initial results.'' 
    \textbf{Use vector image formats (.pdf) where possible}. Size figures appropriately, and do not make them over-large or too small to read.
    }

    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be typeset correctly and precisely. Make sure you get parenthesis sizing correct, and punctuate equations correctly 
(the comma is important and goes \textit{inside} the equation block). Explain any symbols used clearly if not defined earlier. 

For example, we might define:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{2\pi i x \xi} \right],
\end{equation}    
where $\hat{f}(\xi)$ is the Fourier transform of the time domain signal $f(x)$.

\subsection{Algorithms}
Algorithms can be set using \texttt{algorithm2e}, as in Algorithm \ref{alg:metropolis}.

% NOTE: line ends are denoted by \; in algorithm2e
\begin{algorithm}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \KwData{$f_X(x)$, a probability density function returing the density at $x$.\; $\sigma$ a standard deviation specifying the spread of the proposal distribution.\;
    $x_0$, an initial starting condition.}
    \KwResult{$s=[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, $n$ samples approximately drawn from a distribution with PDF $f_X(x)$.}
    \Begin{
        $s \longleftarrow []$\;
        $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
        $i \longleftarrow 0$\;
        \While{$i < n$}
        {
            $x^\prime \longleftarrow \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$\;
            $p^\prime \longleftarrow f_X(x^\prime)$\;
            $a \longleftarrow \frac{p^\prime}{p}$\;
            $r \longleftarrow U(0,1)$\;
            \If{$r<a$}
            {
                $x \longleftarrow x^\prime$\;
                $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
                $i \longleftarrow i+1$\;
                append $x$ to $s$\;
            }
        }
    }

\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

If you need to include tables, like Table \ref{tab:operators}, use a tool like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to generate the table as it is
extremely tedious otherwise.

\chapter{Evaluation} 
How good is your solution? How well did you solve the general problem, and what evidence do you have to support that?

\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Ask specific questions that address the general problem.
    \item
        Answer them with precise evidence (graphs, numbers, statistical
        analysis, qualitative analysis).
    \item
        Be fair and be scientific.
    \item
        The key thing is to show that you know how to evaluate your work, not
        that your work is the most amazing product ever.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evidence}
Make sure you present your evidence well. Use appropriate visualisations, reporting techniques and statistical analysis, as appropriate.

If you visualise, follow the basic rules, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:boxplot}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Label everything correctly (axis, title, units).
\item Caption thoroughly.
\item Reference in text.
\item \textbf{Include appropriate display of uncertainty (e.g. error bars, Box plot)}
\item Minimize clutter.
\end{itemize}

See the file \texttt{guide\_to\_visualising.pdf} for further information and guidance.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{images/boxplot_finger_distance.pdf}    

    \caption{Average number of fingers detected by the touch sensor at different heights above the surface, averaged over all gestures. Dashed lines indicate
    the true number of fingers present. The Box plots include bootstrapped uncertainty notches for the median. It is clear that the device is biased toward 
    undercounting fingers, particularly at higher $z$ distances.

\chapter{Conclusion}    
Summarise the whole project for a lazy reader who didn't read the rest (e.g. a prize-awarding committee).
\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Summarise briefly and fairly.
    \item
        You should be addressing the general problem you introduced in the
        Introduction.        
    \item
        Include summary of concrete results (``the new compiler ran 2x
        faster'')
    \item
        Indicate what future work could be done, but remember: \textbf{you
        won't get credit for things you haven't done}.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Appendices}

Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copies of ethics approvals (required if obtained)
\item
  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects.
\item
  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.

\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.

\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
submitted separately.
