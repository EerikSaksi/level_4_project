> Anderson et al. (2007) estimated the activity of participants through their cell signals. This study
> was mostly focused on the accuracy at which the neural network estimated. The estimated
> activity levels were shared with friends. The app performed well even without the social signals:
> "participants described how they were would enjoy checking how much walking and running

> another. Competition seemed to be effective as users "also enjoyed competing among themselves".
> This is interesting, as users did not like competition in the afformentioned app Healthy Together.
> Morrison and Bakayov (2017) developed "Stickers for Steps" an Android sticker collecting app.
> Stickers are collected through reaching step count targets. Users could receive duplicate stickers,
> which incentiviced users to trade stickers. Users could only trade stickers through Bluetooth,
> which encouraged users to meet face to face. This was to gave the users a real sticker collecting

> exchange the inevitable duplicates that will accrue from the random sticker acquisitions". This app
> brought users together as 27/31 of users who had partners traded at least once. Sticker swapping

< I analyzed existing exercise apps, and existing RPG games in order to better understand the
< two categories I am combining. I analyzed Stronglifts 5x5 and Jefit, two popular exercise apps.
< Both had inbuilt social features, and online forums to keep people motivated. They had some
< complicated exercise features like planning workouts, which were out of scope for me. I found
< that Jefit had competitions, but no collaborative exercising. The absence of collaborative features
< showed that there was room to explore the effectiveness of these apps. I had to make sure that I
< implemented at least some of the features of existing popular exercise apps in order to maintain
< user engagement. These were the key features that I noticed in both these apps.
< • Social features (adding friends/chatting)
< • Being able to plan workouts
< • Being able to track a wide variety of exercises
< • Built in exercise tutorials
< • Satisfying animations/congratulating progress
< • Progression suggestions (add more or less weight)
< From my analysis of RPG games, I realized that collaboration is an integral part of RPG games,
< and that existing products should serve as a model for implementing collaborative aspects. For
< instance, Clash of Clans has clans, where users need to give each other troops in order to optimally
< defend themselves. Clans also battle against one another in "Clan Wars" where users have to
< attack each others bases in order to win. Wins require members to attack consistently and to
< reinforce their fellow members (Way 2020). Another example of a collaborative RPG is World of
< Warcraft. In World of Warcraft, users participate in Raids together, which require very detailed
< coordination from all members. There are also multiple different roles which users have to take,
< such as healer, tank, or DPS (damage dealer) (van Schneider 2015). There is a viral video where
< a World of Warcraft player named "Leeroy Jenkins" ruins an entire raid by going in alone as
< the team plans their attack, ruining their whole raid (Webb 2015). Even many singleplayer
< RPG games are built around collaboration. For instance the game Darkest Dungeon Mcmullen
< (2020) is built around controlling your various heroes, who can give each other status bonuses,
< and heal each other. For instance, the Plague Doctor hero is focused on healing others, while a
< Highwayman can deal lots of damage. From these three RPG collaborative games, I derived the
< following key points:
< • Teams should fight against other players (or non-player characters)
< • Users should be encouraged to help each other
< • Users should have specific roles that serve some purpose in achieving the end goal.
< • There should be some clear progression: both on an individual level and on a team level.
< These should be linked (the team should progress faster if individual users are progressing)
< • There should be accountability: if some user(s) aren’t doing their part, they should not
< progress.

< Since the app was collaborative, I wanted users to be able to invite any of their friends to

< As I already had some experience with React, I decided to use React Native. There are some

< the iOS app was difficult, so I wanted the iOS app to stray from the Android version as little as
< possible.
< I decided to use Expo, which is a superset of React Native. You can create a React Native app

< February 12th I used to ask for ethical approval with a built in form that the user was required

< hadn’t signed the form, the user’s browser would open with my website. The username field in
< the ethics form would be prefilled with the username they had tried to sign up with in the app.

< In order to evaluate the effectiveness of my app in inducing behavioral change, I sent a survey to
< all participants.
< Interviews take much longer than surveys, as you have to schedule conduct, transcribe, and
< analyze them. I only interviewed 10 people. In order to maximize the value of each interview, I
< classified users in to different categories, and sampled from each group. Some users belonged to
< more than one category.
< Commonly mentioned techinical issues in interview A lot of users mentioned the same bugs

< and probably had to do something with parent component refreshing.
< Patterns: Both MVP’s talked about how they want to be the best in their team. They don’t view
< it so much as collaboration but more as competition. This competitiveness could lead them to be
< the MVP, or vice versa.
< User 1: Team MVP and 5 person team member, most active member in the game Team MVP
< "If everyone would have been contributing equally, I think it will be like even more like, ah, like,
< I’ve put, I would have put like, much more effort into it." "I just like did all the damage to except
< at one point. Then I just like commented that, ’where are you guys’? And like, ’are there all the
< gyms closed in the in Helsinki’ and stuff like that?" "And you could like click it and see like all
< the movements they did in the gym, and the weights and the like the reps. I think it will be a bit
< more interesting. And for people who like like competition it would be something fun." As he
< we was annoyed that other users didn’t feel an obligation to help, we discussed whether it would
< make sense to divide users into classes which all have to work together. "You will even have like
< a kind of like social pressure to do a workout. If your team success is based on your stamina stat
< or something like that." When asked how he would feel if they had to rely on their teammates
< more and someone would still be a broken link, he replied: "If my progress in the game would
< be relying on someone who doesn’t do anything. I think it would be a bit unmotivatingfor me."
< Most active member "the gyms haven’t been even closed, and there’s like no restrictions." Already
< trained consistently Used fitnotes app before Knew the team’s members
< Issues Keyboard overlap problem (could work around it) Exercises unsaving when saving new
< lifts Animations taking a long time to load (probably has to do with calculate strength) Thought
< animations were too pixelated (which is expected for pixel art) With regards to user animations
< "I think there was this frog guy was like King of deadlift leverage, or something like that. I think

< He said that he would be carrying his team in a pretty satisfied tone: "If it was under normal

< it." "I cared more about the workouts because I feel like there was more of a sense of progress
< with them." "But I did think, yeah, I felt like in terms of my character, there wasn’t too much
< progression there. The goal for me was the battles I think." "For me, I didn’t really struggle with
< motivation, right? I would be working out the same whether I had this app or not. I think I like
< the fact that it was it was a bit of extra reward."
< Question: "I wanted advanced people have to work like a year to add like two kilos. So I kind
< of wanted to just reward their effort. So as an advanced lifter, would you say that it worked in
< your case?" Answer: "I would say so. Yeah, it’s exactly like you said in terms of the character
< progression"
< Misc Used websites which tell you relative strength, such as Symmetric Strength before, which
< all my calculations are based on. Makes sense why he enjoyed the app Liked how simple the app

> Ethical considerations
> 
> When designing my app, I implemented alerts which are triggered if users progress too quickly
> to prevent users from progressing without caring about technique. Users raised other potential
> ethical considerations to my app which I had not accounted for. User 1 mentioned how my
> app could lead to users doing too many workouts: "If I do like five gym sessions per week, but
> if that wouldn’t be enough [to defeat the enemy], it wouldn’t be very good for my health like
> to do like, seventh or eighth, gym session.". In a similar vain, User 4 thinks that my app could
> lead to users prioritizing game progress over sensible training if the game is poorly balanced:
> "You shouldn’t be able to game the system, do lots of fluff work just to inflate your numbers, all
> training styles should be accounted for". User 7 mentioned that I should be considerate about
> adding new features, such as calorie tracking: "It would probably lead to eating disorders where
> people lose a bunch of weight".

> Collaboration vs competitiveness
> 
> User 7 and User 8 were both in the same teamI asked both users whether their motivation was
> driven by collaboration or competition. User 7, who was strongest in the team responded: "I
> think, at the start, I would tell User 8 ’Yo, I just did a workout I just did this much damage,
> the boss is almost dead, you need to work out’". This was mostly collaborative: User 7 trained
> to help the team out, and wanted the User 8 to help him defeat the enemies. I asked User 8
> the same question, and he reiterated the same sentiment as User 7: "We never spoke about
> being competitive". User 8 was a bit weaker than User 7, and he gave me insight into how this
> influenced his motivation: "I think User 7 did a couple more workouts than me, and I was trying
> to keep up with him. I think it was definetely competitive there." This intrigued me, as User 8
> felt competive as the underdog, but the strongest member in the team did not feel competitive.
> This lead to User 8 putting in more effort: "The app probably added an extra workout every
> week." This is what I hoped that the app design would lead to: users that are weaker and who
> train less wanting to keep up with other users

> A common feature suggestion was that exercises should be divided by bodypart. In addition
> to making searching for exercises a bit easier, users liked and suggested adding this as an ingame feature. "Yeah it makes kind of sense if you have bodypart specific armor that maybe if
> you do arms a lot you get a battle axe." I discussed this idea further with users who had some
> experience with games and RPG’s. Some users suggested making RPG style quests: "If you
> kill a certain enemy 10 times you get a weapon". This same user thinks that content is key to
> maintain users long term: "You need to add a lot of content, as muscle building and training
> can be a slow process". Although unrealistic, one user suggested giving sponsored prices for
> in-game achievement: "First person to reach x level or beat y challenge wins something such as a
> supplements from sponsor".
> Although most users agreed that real life strength should remain important, many suggested
> adding rewards which are based around using the app: "There should be rewards for using and
> engaging with the app that don’t require real world improvement". Rewarding app use would
> hopefully reduce inequalities among beginners and users which already train. User 7 and User 8
> also had a beginner in their team, who tracked only one workout, but dealt a fraction of what
> User 7 and User 8, and lost interest. Small inequalities can be motivating: for instance, User 8
> worked harder to catch up to User 7. There are many ’pay to win’ apps which let users play the
> game for free, but which lock long-term progression behind a paywall. I could copy this, but
> through a ’train to win’ model, which would only allow users to progress beyond the early stages
> if they trained.
