Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

- **Week 1**
  Create the plan for the entire project, do some more background research on other similar software, and maybe some psychology on behaviour change. I am pretty set on what technologies I want to use, but I still need to do research them. Ideally I have my React Native enviroment up by this week, and things like device emulators working. I have been meaning to use a backend technlogy called PostGraphile for a while now, so I should get that set up. I want to try to register an API that converts exercise performance to different categories so I can make tiered items.
- **Week 2**
  I want to start creating some basic UI pages. I should start creating database relations and React components to present the data. I should set up some kind of login that works on the backend and the frontend. 
- **Week 3**
  I should start implementing functionality to the app. Users should be able to join teams, see their exercise performance
- **Week 5**
  I should start calculating player damage per second and making enemies that should be beat by for example beginners, and some that should be beat by better players. Enemy healhpoints should scale with team size.

- **Week 6**
  I should look in to getting some art packs and giving for example weapons and armor damage and tiers as you level up. 
- **Week 7**
  I should have a simple welcome tutorial for new users that explains how the app works concisely. I should also implement some further tutorials that are triggered by a user interacting or pressing a question mark. 

- **Week 8**
  I should implement metric tracking that will be useful in the evalutation stage.
- **Week 9**
  This will likely take another week to fully implement and test.
- **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**

- **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
