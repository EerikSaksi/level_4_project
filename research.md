## "Pass the Ball: Enforced Turn-Taking in Activity Tracking" (paper recommended by supervisor)

### This paper wasn't exactly what my project was, but here are the key takeaways that would apply to my project

- Collaboration over competition
- Don't let one active person carry the team
- Tracking should be effortless if not automatic
- Competition with teams is good
- Rules for point scoring should exist, but straying should be allowed but with a penalty
- Providing windows of opportunity to score points encourages coordination and accountability to make use of your opportunity
- Although encouraging structure has advantages for adherance, it can work badly for people who can't for example exercise at a particular time every week or for people who join an existing team that has structure
- Perhaps avoid punishments and only deal in opportunities and opportunity caused because of the negative view on interceptions
- Public leaderboard encourage within team activity but also competitiveness in other teams
- Privacy should be transparent for the user

## Existing fitness tracker: JEFIT

Existing features and will I also implement them:

- Primary selling point is being able to design workouts with exercises categorized by muscle group and equipment
  - I will most likely only include a certain amount of exercises that are included in the strength calculation API. I will probably not include a workout planner, as I want to be able to accomodate people with more unstructured plans that still like to track progress.
- Includes pre made workout plans
  - Again, I will not even include the ability to make workouts. I might give some general guidelines that you should adhere to.
- Includes ability to add friends and includes social feed, but very basic (only shows completed workouts and profile picture changes) so this is clearly not a high priority.
  - This will definetely be important. I might not have a feed, but something like leaderboards and ability to see friend and rival progress.
- Instructions and short gifs showcasing movements
  - I might just include links to some good videos
- Ability to view workout streak and progress
  - This will definetely be important. Instead of showing say lifting progress, I might instead focus on the score progress (the gamified progress). Streaks should definetely impact your teams points to encourage consistency.
- Whenever you get a new record a big popup shows up
  - I should definetely maximize that dopamine surge whenever you get a new record.

Missing features that I hope to include:

- No competitions between friends
- No collaborative training
- No ability to compete with other individuals and other teams
- Fitness hasn't been gamified, or abstracted for motivation
- No heatmap of body showing progress and relative weaknesses and strengths

## Existing clicking game: Clicker Heroes

Existing features and will I also implement them:

- Enemy level progression: Whenever you defeat an enemy you get a harder enemy and progress in the game
  - This will be the primary way to compare teams to each other, what enemy level you have gotten to.
- Limited time frames to defeat enemies
  - I will implement this, as I don't want people to defeat very difficult enemies through shear patience, but you should eventually come across an enemy that is too strong and requires more consistency and better performance.
- Damage per second progression: you can spend money to unlock heroes that make you deal more damage, even when idle from the game.
  - I want to implement different armor you can wear, that will increase your damage per second. Better armor for different body parts are unlocked by getting stronger in exercises that use that particular body part.
- Clicking damage: Clicking enemies deals damage, so you have passive and active damage
  - I probably want to avoid allowing to progress through simply tapping the screen. I think passive and active progress is important so you always feel as if you make progress outside of the game and more while you play it. I think one way of encouraging (active) progress is to give bonuses for checking in and saying you completed your workout. Active progress also occurs when you update your exercises and unlock better items to deal more damage. The game will also have active progress through teammates encouraging each other to perform. I could consider simply rewarding players for opening the app every day (kind of like a snap streak) as users are more likely to then also track their workouts, compare themselves to other teams and pay attention to their current monster they're fighting.
